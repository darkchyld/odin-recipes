    <h1>Taiwanese Meat Sauce With Rice</h1>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups vegetable or canola oil</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups thinly sliced shallots</li>
                <li>2 pounds ground pork</li>
                <li>2 medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 cup light soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup Chinese rice cooking wine</li>
                <li>Water</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Line a large plate with a triple layer of paper towels. Heat oil to 325Â°F in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and adjust flame to maintain temperature. Add shallots and cook, stirring constantly with a slotted spoon or wire mesh spider, until shallots are a pale golden and barely turning brown in spots, 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately transfer to paper towel lined-plate to drain. Reserve 1 tablespoon oil and reserve the rest for another use. When shallots are cool, lightly crush. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat reserved oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through and beginning to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and the crushed fried shallots to the pan and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Add the five-spice powder and sugar and stir to combine. Add both soy sauces, wine, and just enough water to cover, if necessary, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cover partially. Cook until pork is completely tender and sauce has thickened, 3 to 4 hours. Serve with steamed rice..</li>
